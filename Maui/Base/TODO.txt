File cache image metadata
    Internal hash to check if file is replaced with different file of same name, recompute metadata if so
    On load check if metadata file needs update
    Auto save metadata only if there is an update to the file when close the program.
When load we do lazy load, thus related info will not be there during save if nothing is loaded, re-evaluate this behavior
UI display image loaded from disk
    Display image from path
    Group by sha256 hash view
More image matching algo
    Image similarity algo that doesn't require exact matching
        Research for existing soltion
        Resolution diff only mode
        Similar mode (can be slitly different in color, Mosaic, only differet in some text bubble, etc)
    Sort image by general color of upper left corner of the image
Backend thread check/recompute organization collection when any sub folder is changed (by date? by hash?)
File cache image organization collection vs only cache image metadata? (might have different types of collections)
    Do the same for organization collection as image metadata if decided to save
